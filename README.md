# Vagrant Lamp
This is my setup for vagrant

# How to use ?
Put Vagrantfile, bootstrap.sh and mysqldump.sh inside a folder and do a ```vagrant up``` on the command line. This box uses Ubuntu 14.04 LTS "Trustry Thar" 64bit, so if you don't have the basic box already, do a ```vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64``` before.
